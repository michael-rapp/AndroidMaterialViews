=============================


About
-----

"AndroidMaterialViews" is an Android-library, which provides various views, which are suggested
by Android's Material Design guidelines, but which are not provided by the official Android SDK.
The library's views can also be used on pre-Lollipop devices.

The library provides the following views:

    -   A CircularProgressBar, which visualizes an indeterminate progress bar as an animated 
        circle. 
        
    -   A FloatingActionButton, which is a round, colored button with a shadow and an icon.
        The button supports to become shown or hidden in an animated manner.
